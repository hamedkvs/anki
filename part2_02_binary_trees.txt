What are binary trees# Trees that each element can have maximum number of two children
binary search tree conitions#condition that sould be met by every node: left child value < node value < right child value
give and example of logarithmic time complexity# binary search tree. in every step we threw half of our items away
binary search tree runtimes#Lookup O(Log n), Insertion O(Log n), Deletion O(Log n). I all we have to find the element witch takes O(Log n)
Tree elements# nodes(leaf nodes, root node, parent node, child node) and edges
When you iterate(traverse) through a collection(tree) what variable name suits you for the item in each iteration#current
what is breath first traversal? give an alternative name for this traversal.#level order traversal - It starts at the tree root and explores all nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level. Wikipedia
Depth first types and their node traverse order# Pre-order <ROOT>, LEFT, RIGHT / In-order LEFT, <ROOT>, RIGHT / Post-order LEFT, RIGHT, <ROOT>
Witch traversal is better when we want to traverse from its leaves up to the root?#Post-order traversal
what data structure Java use for implementing recursion?#Stack
base condition for implementing a factorial by recursion?#if(n==0) return 1
recursive function 2 main parts#A recursive function definition has one or more base cases, meaning input(s) for which the function produces a result trivially (without recurring), and one or more recursive cases, meaning input(s) for which the program recurs (calls itself). Wikipedia
what is the height of a tree#height of its root node
what is the height of a node#The height of a node is the length of the longest downward path to a leaf from that node. Wikipedia
what is the depth of a node#The depth of a node is the length of the path to its root (i.e., its root path). Wikipedia
